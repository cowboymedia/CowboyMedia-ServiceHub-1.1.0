# ServiceHub - Service Status & Support Platform

## Overview
ServiceHub is a comprehensive Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to provide a centralized platform for service status monitoring and customer support. It enables customers to track service health, receive real-time alerts via push notifications, access news updates, and submit support tickets with integrated real-time messaging. For administrators, the platform offers extensive control over users, services, alerts, and news content. A key ambition is to deliver a native app-like experience through PWA capabilities, ensuring accessibility and engagement across devices.

## System Architecture
ServiceHub is built with a modern web stack, emphasizing PWA capabilities and real-time communication.

### UI/UX Decisions
The frontend utilizes React with Vite, styled using TailwindCSS and Shadcn UI for a clean, modern aesthetic. Wouter is used for routing. The application supports dark/light mode toggling and features a mobile-responsive design with safe area support. Image lightboxes are implemented for an enhanced viewing experience.

### Technical Implementations
- **Frontend**: React, Vite, TailwindCSS, Shadcn UI, Wouter.
- **Backend**: Express.js, secured with session-based authentication using scrypt for password hashing.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, managed via Drizzle ORM.
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSockets are used for real-time messaging in ticket support and admin chat functionalities.
- **File Management**: Multer is used for file uploads, storing data as base64 in the PostgreSQL `uploaded_files` table.
- **PWA Features**: Implemented with a Service Worker and Web App Manifest for installability on mobile devices, providing an offline-first and native app-like experience.
- **Push Notifications**: Utilizes the Web Push API with VAPID for service alerts and ticket updates, avoiding third-party services like OneSignal or Firebase.
- **Email Services**: Integration with SendGrid for all transactional email communications.

### Feature Specifications
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Local username/password authentication with a robust admin role system. `master_admin` has full access, while custom admin roles have granular, permission-based access (`users.view`, `services.manage`, `admin_chat`, `support_tickets`, etc.).
- **Service Monitoring**: Comprehensive service status tracking with subscription options. Alerts automatically update service statuses (degraded/outage/maintenance) and resolve to operational. Consolidated push and email notifications are sent for alert events.
- **Support Ticketing**: Category-based ticket system with access control, allowing specific admin roles to view, claim, and interact with tickets. Real-time messaging, ticket transfer capabilities between admins, and visibility controls for claimed tickets are included.
- **Admin Communications**: Real-time admin chat with threads and file attachments. `master_admin` can send broadcast priority alerts that persist and require acknowledgment.
- **Customer Engagement**: News stories with photo support, private messaging from admins to customers (with push, email, and in-app popups), and a customer message center with unread badges.
- **User Onboarding**: Setup reminder system with in-app dialogs and email notifications to encourage push notification and service configuration.
